# OTP Sending Service using FastAPI, Celery, and Redis

This is a simple backend service that sends OTPs (One-Time Passwords) to users via SMS. It uses:

- **FastAPI** for the API layer
- **Celery** for asynchronous task processing
- **Redis** as a message broker and rate limiter

## Features

- Send OTP to a given mobile number
- Rate limiting: only 10 OTPs can be sent per minute
- Queued OTP delivery: if rate limit is exceeded, OTPs are delayed using Celery
- Asynchronous processing using Celery with Redis
- Environment-independent (works locally and can scale with Docker or cloud services)
